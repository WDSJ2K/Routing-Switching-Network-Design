### First Cycle Remediation Summary (Lab Environment)

As part of a structured network assessment and maintenance exercise, remediation efforts reduced total identified issues by **80%**, decreasing findings from **30 to 6**.  
All critical issues were resolved by the second scan (**100% resolution**), and high-severity findings were reduced by **90%**. Medium-severity issues were reduced by **76%**.

In a real-world NOC or enterprise environment, remediation priorities would be guided by **asset criticality, uptime requirements, and operational impact**, in addition to severity ratings.

### Ongoing Network Maintenance & Monitoring (Maintenance Mode)

After completing the initial remediation cycle, the environment transitions into **Maintenance Mode**. This phase reflects standard **Network Operations Center (NOC)** practices focused on system stability, visibility, and long-term reliability.

Maintenance Mode emphasizes proactive monitoring, routine updates, and consistent validation to ensure systems remain operational and resilient over time.  
(See the [Finalized Maintenance Policy](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rvueLX_71pOR8ldN9zVW9r_zLzDQxVsnSUtNar8ftdg/edit?usp=drive_link) for scanning and update cadence used in this lab.)

Key activities during Maintenance Mode include: 

- **Scheduled System & Network Scans**  
  Perform routine scans (weekly or monthly) to validate system health as configurations and workloads change.

- **Patch & Update Management**  
  Apply operating system and application updates to maintain stability and reduce operational risk.

- **Verification & Follow-ups**  
  Re-scan systems after updates to confirm issues have been resolved and no regressions were introduced.

- **Configuration Review**  
  Periodically review system and network configurations to ensure alignment with operational standards.

- **Documentation & Change Tracking**  
  Maintain clear records of findings, remediation actions, and validation results to support troubleshooting and audits.

- **Cross-Team Communication**  
  Coordinate findings and remediation actions clearly, reflecting real-world collaboration between NOC, systems, and engineering teams.

By maintaining a structured monitoring and maintenance process, network operations teams can reduce downtime, improve reliability, and respond more effectively to changes in the environment.
